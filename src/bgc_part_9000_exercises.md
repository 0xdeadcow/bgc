# Exercises

These are the exercises for the various chapters.

## Intro {#ex-intro}

1. Modify the "Hello, world!" example to print your name instead.

1. Modify the "Hello, world!" example to print your name one one line,
   and your favorite fruit on the next.

## Variables and Statements {#ex-var-stat}

1. An approximation of $\pi$ is $208341 / 66317$. Write a program that
   computes this, stores the result in a `float` variable, and prints it
   out.

1. Choose a random integer in your head between 50 and 97. Call it $x$.
   Compute $(x+10*2-5)/2$ as an integer and print it.

1. Do the same thing as the previous problem, except divide it by `2.0`
   instead of `2` and store the result in a `float`. And print it.

1. Let's say you have a variable `i = 2`. Write a program that assigns
   `j = i + 7` (to get `9`) _and_ then increments `i` on the same line
   of code.

1. Let's say you have a variable `i = 2`. Write a program that
   decrements `i` _and_ then assigns `j = i + 7` (to get `8`) on the
   same line of code.

1. Choose a value for an integer variable `i`. Write a program that
   prints `"foo"` if `i` is greater than 17, otherwise it prints
   `"bar"`.

1. If you used `if`-`else` for the previous problem, do the same thing
   using the ternary operator. Otherwise, do the reverse.
