# Pointers II {#pointers2}

Time to get more into it with a number of new pointer topics! If you're
not up to speed with pointers, [check out the first section in the guide
on the matter](#pointers).

## Array/Pointer Equivalence

### Pointer Arithmetic

Turns out you can do math on pointers, notably addition and subtraction.

But what does it mean when you do that?

In short, if you have a pointer to a type, adding one to the pointer
moves to the next item of that type directly after it in memory.
